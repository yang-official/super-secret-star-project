My son, my son, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you get this gold
In the black, in the black
With the stars to my back
Where I'd shiver the whole night through

My son, my son, where did you go
I went where the dark matter flows
In the black, in the black
With the stars to my back
Where I'd shiver the whole night through

My father was a hard working man
On the edge of the outer rim
His head was found in the driving gears
But his body never was found

My son, my son, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you get this gold
In the black, in the black
With the stars to my back
Where I'd shiver the whole night through

My son, my son, where did you go
I went where the dark matter flows
In the black, in the black
With the stars to my back
Where I'd shiver the whole night through

My son, my son, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you get this gold
In the black, in the black
With the stars to my back
Where I shiver the whole night through

My son, my son, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you get this gold
In the black, in the black
With the stars to my back
Where I'd shiver whole night through
