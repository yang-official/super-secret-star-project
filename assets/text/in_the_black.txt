My son, my son, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you get this gold
In the black, in the black, with the stars to my back
I'd shiver the whole night through

My son, my son, where will you go
I'm going where the dark matter flows
In the black, in the black, with the stars to my back
I'd shiver the whole night through

My father was a hard working man
On the edge of the outer rim
His head was found in the driving gears
But his body never was found

The longest train I ever saw
Went by this moon's dark side
The loot slipped out the cargo hold
I watched it all drift by

My son, my son, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you get this gold
In the black, in the black, with the stars to my back
I'd shiver the whole night through

My son, my son, where will you go
I'm going where the dark matter flows
In the black, the black, the stars to my back
I shiver the whole night through
